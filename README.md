HL2Quest is a port of Half Life 2 to the Quest 1 & 2 based off of Lambda1VR, It works by reading Source files instead of GoldSRC Files, Meaning it can essentially run
Source games like it was Source, Even though it's actually Xash3D.
Installation
Using Sidequest, Install the app, Than make a folder in the root folder of the Quest named "xash", Make a folder inside xash named "hl2", Next,
Go into your Half Life 2 directory and you'll find a folder that also has the name "hl2", Copy the contents from this folder into the hl2 folder on your Quest,
And than you can play!
